   * obtainer thread to do the work of obtaining a lease or renewing lease.

   * The function of this thread is to call LeasableLock::RefreshLease API to
   * refresh lease i.e. obtain a new lease, and invoke a callback of
   * LeaseTransitionCallback to let the user of lease manager know that
   * something has changed on the lease.
   *
   * If lease obtainer thread takes long to execute the RefreshLease and
   * Callback, lease expiration enforcer terminates the process to recover from
   * getting stuck.
