   * threshold, see below man page snippet.
   *
   * $ man ntpd
   *    Under ordinary conditions, ntpd *slews the clock* so that the time is
   *    effectively continuous and never runs backwards. If due to extreme
   *    network congestion an error spike exceeds the step threshold, by default
   *    128 ms, the spike is discarded. However, if the error persists for more
   *    than the stepout threshold, by default 900 s, the system clock is
   *    stepped to the correct value. In practice the need for a step has is
   *    extremely rare and almost always the result of a hardware failure. With
   *    the -x option the step threshold is increased to 600 s.
